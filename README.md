# Action Cache (formerly shortcut manager)
This is an app I made to keep track of shortcuts and have a visual indicator of where shortcuts are on my keyboard. As more time then not id either map shortcuts to custom keys
on my keyboard or on another layer entirely this with introducing new software that added even more shortcuts to remember ment id tend to only use a small select few 
and missout on using others that were usefull to my workflow. The combination of logging the keybinds with the visual representaion of where and in what order they are pressed makes
learning and rememebering new shortcuts much more manageable. 

Plans to use better pracitces and change this project from just being a shortcut manager but to also manage useful cli commands
